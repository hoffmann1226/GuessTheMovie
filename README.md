# GuessTheMovie

This is a fun little game where a player is prompted to guess a movie choosing individual letters.  When the program is run, the player will be prompted to guess a letter.  If the letter is in the word, the program will show where it appears in the hidden word.  If the letter has already been guessed, the program will tell the user to pick a different letter.  The user is allowed 15 guesses to guess the movie.  If they fail to figure it out in 15 guesses, they lose.  If they succeed in figuring out the movie, they win and the program exits.
